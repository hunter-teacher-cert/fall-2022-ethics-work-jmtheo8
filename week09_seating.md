Week09 Assignment PART I & PART 2

PART 1
Passenger seat booking algorithm considerations.

The seating algorithm will sort purchased tickets based on:

Group ticket purchasing: 
Personal travel and business passengers can be separated however families should remain seated close.

Data Types:
Common last names paired with age of passengers - To distinguish personal travel and business passengers from family members and to verify family members and ensure block seating assignments to increase customer satisfaction.

Date of Ticket Purchase:
Early ticket purchasers receive a discount for seats on flight that are booked around premium blocks for specified passengers, i.e. family blocks, individuals with disabilities.
Five days before ticket purchasers receive a smaller discount with limited seating choices, filling middle seats between specified passengers.
Last minute ticket purchasers will be billed a higher cost inclusive of revenue lost to early ticket purchase assign “discounts”. Seat assignment will be determined at check in, with non refundable caveats/

Type of Seating Plan:
Family Plus: Families of three plus members can book in blocks in certain designated cabin areas for an additional fee. These seats will ensure that families can be in close proximity.
Disability considerations: Seating priority for disabled individuals.
Traveling Pet considerations: Passengers will be paying a higher premium for seating to accommodate pets, which ensures that they will not present an obstacle to fellow passengers.
VIP travelers who have purchased all the “bells and whistles” offers: window or aisle seating, food, entertainment etc, should be seated in the customer valued areas, more feet room, away from potential crying children, pets etc. 

Note:
To make this system work and to navigate all the considerations, seats will be evaluated by an algorithm and result in a seating plan that is given/assigned to all passengers within 24 hour of the flight to ensure an equitable seating arrangement that accommodates the needs of all passengers. A point system, attached to future flight discount or inservice offers like free snacks, free headphones, blanket, kid coloring books, based on customer feedback will be added to attract returning customers.
