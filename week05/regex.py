# Practice Exmples worked out:
# Regular expression (regex), the standared for parsing text in python
# It is good for debugging code
# Scraping the web
# Verifing user input
# e Code built in colab

#example_string =""" Math, philosophy, computer science and sometimes language 
#all try to deliver a complete representation of the world. that may lead to 
#better understandings and the exposure of inconsistencies and gaps. 
#In order to complete the picture, problem may be approached from two sides: 
#A) From one side we expand our knowledge. B)From the other we work on breaking 
#the mysteries down to little digestible bits  to match with inferred and apporved 
#axioms. Logic is a discipline. Sometimes logical problems need to be approached 
#from both sides. Logic is relevant.  With logic we can find modes of agreement. 
#We can find out if something is true or false, right or wrong. Itâ€™s a cognitive 
#science that is branching into math, philosophy, language. It is also a solid 
#basis for accumulating knowledge in the natural sciences. Step 2. One of the 
#essential tools in propositional logic is the connection of two arguments into 
#a complex one. A computer does exactly that and uses electricity to accelerate 
#and automate the process. A computer can let us observe logic in action. 
#It allows us to see if ideas about the world match how the world actually works. 
#The number of questions that can be asked and worlds that can be created and 
#observed is extremely high. Logic is expressed and communicated through 
language. -Source: http://www.cs4fn.org/poems/shapingpoems.php
